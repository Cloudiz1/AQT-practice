## AQT Quiz web app
This is a simple web app which converts the sample questions (in the form of pdfs) from the NAQT website to flash cards

## TODO:
- Convert `questions.json` to work frontend
- Create the entire web part of the web app :thumbsup:
- three more pdfs to convert (as they have a different format from the rest)

## Done:
- basically just converted all the pdfs to questions
